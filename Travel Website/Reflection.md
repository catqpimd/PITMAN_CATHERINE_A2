I have to be fully transparent with you rn...
I completely forgot this project existed until this tuesday...

so please keep in mind everything i have done was over the course of the past 4 days.
that was entirely my fault and i definitely suffered the consequences for it i think between tuesday and thursday i got maybe a total of 8 hours of sleep? but its fineeee because im actually pretty happy with how things came out. I even managed to finish EARLY, it is currently 10 pm which means I have two hours to spare! Delightful.

anyways yeah i think the fact that I made my site on an already very much beloved video game made things a lot easier for sure. i mean there are whole wikipedias dedicated to this game and they are THOUROUGH 

Pretty much all the pictures and assets I used were freely accessible online so instead of spending a bunch of time trying to get everything for my vision together I was able to focus a lot more on the fun interactive bits. The map sections im especially proud of. OH also yeah i should say now that the town overview is my "gallery" page from the requirements. I just felt like calling it gallery wouldnt really make sense with the overall theme of everything.

I think if I had started this assignment earlier I probably wouldve added some extra little animations on the home screen and i had wayyyyy more plans for my little pop up mayor lewis then i got to really execute but still pretty please with it. I also wouldve liked to make the npc profiles a bit more interesting then just taking you to their wiki page but there are sooooooo many npcs and i didnt even include all of them so that woudlve taken me probably a whole extra day just to do that.

but yeah in generally all things considered this was a very stressful experience (entirely my fault and honestly mostly bc i found out i had a huge job interview friday morning literally 5 minutes before I was reminded this assignment existed) but I am happy with how it turned out. In fact I would like to figure out how to be able to attach this to my portfolio somehow without having to make people download the whole zip file and everything. Yeah anyways hope you enjoy my assignment byeee

ps. sorry i missed class thursday i got 3 hours of sleep that night and could not bear to take the oc transpo at 630 am
